Structure: collection of different data types

SYNTAX:
struct name{                     
    char name[100];              
    int rollNumb;
    float CGPA;
}

struct name n1;
n1.CGPA=7.5;
n1.name = 'sfss';

structure are stored in continous memory location



POINTERS TO STRUCTURE: 

same as other but only differnnce is that "struct"

struct  student s1;
struct student*ptr;
ptr=&s1;


struct as2 = {0}: null value to all 

struct student s1 = {34,8.9,"Aubaid"}; // direct declaration but keep in mind the order - must be same as that of when making struct
then print - s1.roll or something 



//
Arrow Operator:

s1.roll == (*ptr).roll == ptr->roll

// 
PASSING STRUCTURE TO FUNCTION: 

void name(struct student s1);



typedef Keyword : used to create alias for data types 

alias  : alternative names 

typedef struct ComputerStudet{
    int roll;
    float cgpa;
    char name[200];
} cs;

this cs will be used against ComputerStudet
like : cs student

cs s1;
s1.roll = 23;
printf("%%d\n",s1.name);


VECTORS :   SAME AS IN PHYSICS
