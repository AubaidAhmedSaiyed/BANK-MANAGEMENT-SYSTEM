Character array terminated by '\0'(Null character)

Null Character : string termination

char name[] = {'A','B','C','\0'};
char namme[] = "ABC";

"all character are in consecutive memory location "

char name[]  = "shradha";

printf/scanf("%s",name);


scanf(): cannot input multi word strings with spaces  

so : used: gets():input OR fgets(str,n,stdin):inpuit & puts(str):output


STRING USING POINTERS:

char*str = "AUBAID";
store string in mmemory and assignned addrsss is stroed in char pointer str


IN THIS WE CAN Reinitialized/change with same name  
but in array notation : we can not


"Null character not include in length of string"



strlen(str): Library function for length 
strcpy(newstr,oldstr): copy value f olfd string to new string
strcat(First,Second) : Concatenate two strings 
first strings must have large space left fro sec string to concatenate

strcmp(first, sec): compare two strings and returns a value
INT VALUE IS RETURN
if 0 : strung equal
if +ve : first>second(ASCII)
if -ve : first<second(ASCII)


strtok() :  used to parse the string (break string based o n spacific delimeter)

char *ptr (create pointer )  = strtok(string,delimeter) = for one time 
if want to continue more :
aftewr first one :
ptr  = strtok(NULL,delimeter); gives null - it act as a refernece to tell it that goes after it 

till ptr becomes NULL 


Mechanism:

pointer points to first letter ;

then using strtok pointer  - it replaces delimeter with NULL character and then print before  null character 

hnce after first time - pointer goes to character after that null character
